Get provider consent URL

Builds and returns, as a string, the OAuth 2.0 consent URL of one external provider - the address a client  opens in a browser so that the user can grant this portal access to their account. The provider's client id,  secret and redirect URI have to be saved for the portal first with `POST api/2.0/settings/authservice`;  without them the URL has no `client_id` and the provider refuses it. Any signed-in portal user may call it,  and the call is read-only and safe to repeat. The URL carries `response_type=code`, the portal's `client_id`,  the provider's `redirect_uri`, the scope the portal needs (Drive with offline access for Google, `signature`  for DocuSign) and a `state` pointing back at this portal's `thirdparty/{provider}/code` page, where the code  arrives in the URL fragment as `#code=...`, or `#error/...` when the user declines. Only Google `1`, Dropbox  `2`, Docusign `3`, Box `4`, OneDrive `5`, Wordpress `10` and Github `13` produce a URL; any other value is  answered with 200 and no URL instead of an error. With `desktop=true`, the whole query string is copied into  `state` and comes back on the callback. The code is not exchanged here: pass it on as `token` to  `POST api/2.0/files/thirdparty` to connect the account.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'docspace-api-sdk'
# setup authorization
DocspaceApiSdk.configure do |config|
  # Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic
  config.username = 'YOUR USERNAME'
  config.password = 'YOUR PASSWORD'

  # Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: OAuth2
  config.access_token = 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN'

  # Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyBearer
  config.api_key['ApiKeyBearer'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['ApiKeyBearer'] = 'Bearer'

  # Configure API key authorization: asc_auth_key
  config.api_key['asc_auth_key'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['asc_auth_key'] = 'Bearer'

  # Configure Bearer authorization (JWT): Bearer
  config.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

end

api_instance = DocspaceApiSdk::ThirdParty::ThirdPartyApi.new
provider = DocspaceApiSdk::LoginProvider::Facebook # LoginProvider | The provider whose consent screen is wanted. Only Google, Dropbox, Docusign, Box, OneDrive, Wordpress and  Github produce a URL; any other provider is answered with 200 and no URL rather than an error. The provider  credentials have to be saved with `POST api/2.0/settings/authservice` first, or the URL comes back without a  client identifier and the provider refuses it.

begin
  # Get provider consent URL
  result = api_instance.get_third_party_code(provider)
  p result
rescue DocspaceApiSdk::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling ThirdParty::ThirdPartyApi->get_third_party_code: #{e}"
end
```

#### Using the get_third_party_code_with_http_info variant

This returns an Array which contains the response data, status code and headers.

> <Array(<StringWrapper>, Integer, Hash)> get_third_party_code_with_http_info(provider)

```ruby
begin
  # Get provider consent URL
  data, status_code, headers = api_instance.get_third_party_code_with_http_info(provider)
  p status_code # => 2xx
  p headers # => { ... }
  p data # => <StringWrapper>
rescue DocspaceApiSdk::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling ThirdParty::ThirdPartyApi->get_third_party_code_with_http_info: #{e}"
end
```
