    # Activates the license staged by `POST api/2.0/settings/license` on this self-hosted Enterprise installation:  it records that the license was accepted, promotes the staged file to the active one and rewrites the  portal-wide quota and tariff from it. Upload a file first: with nothing staged and no license on disk there is  nothing to activate. The caller only has to be signed in, and the activation is recorded in the audit trail.  Repeating the call is safe: the acceptance stamp is written only once and the same license is simply applied  again. Read the outcome from the body rather than the status code - an empty string means the license is now  active, and any other string is a message explaining why it is not: no license key was found, the key is not  correct, the installed edition does not match the license type, or the license is expired or too small for the  current user count. The acceptance stamp survives a failed activation, so a corrected file needs nothing  extra. An installation with no license path configured answers that its pricing plan does not support the  option and changes nothing. The operation stays reachable while the portal is unpaid.

No authentication is needed, so it can  be called on a portal nobody has signed in to yet, and the call is read-only.

A `false` answer therefore does not  mean the portal is licensed - it also covers every build that needs no license at all. Nothing here describes  a license already in place, neither its due date nor whether the editing service still accepts it, and the  answer turns to `false` only once a staged file has been activated by `POST api/2.0/settings/license/accept`,  not when it is uploaded.

The answer is `true` when the license was applied and `false` on an installation with no license path  configured at all, such as a SaaS or open-source portal, where nothing is read and nothing changes. A missing  or unreadable file, a mismatched customer or edition, and an editing service that rejects the license all fail  the call instead of answering `false`.
