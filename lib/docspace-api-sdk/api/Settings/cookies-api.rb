The caller needs the portal-settings right of a  DocSpace administrator - the portal owner and a DocSpace administrator qualify, any other member is refused -  and the call is read-only. The pair describes the whole portal rather than the calling user, and it is never  empty: a portal nobody has configured answers `lifeTime` 1440, one day, with `enabled` false. Read the two  fields together, because the number alone does not say how long a session lasts - while `enabled` is false the  stored number is ignored and an issued session is honoured for a year, and `lifeTime` 0 with `enabled` true  means a session that never expires on its own. On an installation whose configuration hides the cookie section  the built-in default pair comes back instead of the stored one. `GET api/2.0/settings` carries the same flag  as `cookieSettingsEnabled` without the number; change the pair with `PUT api/2.0/settings/cookiesettings`.

The caller needs the portal-settings right of a DocSpace  administrator - the portal owner and a DocSpace administrator qualify, any other member is refused - and on an  installation whose configuration hides the cookie section nothing is stored and the call is answered with 402.  A `lifeTime` above 9999 minutes is not rejected but clamped to 9999, while 0 or less clears the number  instead, which with `enabled` true leaves sessions that never expire on their own. Any positive `lifeTime`  raises the session version of the portal: every session issued before the call stops being accepted, and with  `enabled` true the connections behind them are dropped as well. The caller is signed in again inside the same  call and gets a fresh session cookie in the response, so a client that keeps sending the token it held before  this call is the one locked out. The change is recorded in the audit trail. What comes back is a localized  confirmation message; read the stored pair with `GET api/2.0/settings/cookiesettings`.
