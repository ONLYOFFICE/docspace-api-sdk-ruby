Each entry has the  same shape as in `GET api/2.0/settings/storage`: identifier, title, the authentication keys the provider  expects, and `isSet` telling whether those keys are filled in on the server. Pass `dump=true` to read the  schedule of the whole server instead of the one of the current portal, which only makes sense on a server  installation. The caller needs the permission to edit portal settings, which in practice means the portal  owner or a DocSpace admin, and on an installation that is not a server one the call is also refused unless  backup is available there. Nothing is written and the call is safe to repeat. This operation says nothing  about where the portal data itself lives; the backup schedule is configured through the backup API, and the  storage of the documents through `PUT api/2.0/settings/storage`.

The change  takes effect for links built after it, so a page that is already open may keep pointing at the CDN until it is  reloaded. Repeating the call is harmless, because clearing an empty configuration does nothing. The caller  needs the permission to edit portal settings, which in practice means the portal owner or a DocSpace admin, on  a server installation with an unrestricted access space. Use `GET api/2.0/settings/storage/cdn` to see what is  configured now and `PUT api/2.0/settings/storage/cdn` to select a CDN again; the portal storage of the  documents is untouched by this operation and is reset with `DELETE api/2.0/settings/storage` instead.

    # Reset the storage settings
    # Drops the third-party storage configuration of the current portal, module and saved credentials alike, and  starts an asynchronous migration of the portal data back into the built-in local storage. The portal moves  into the migrating state and stays unavailable until the transfer ends, so follow it with  `GET api/2.0/settings/storage/progress`; the call itself returns as soon as the migration has been handed to  the storage service and gives back no body. The caller needs the permission to edit portal settings, which in  practice means the portal owner or a DocSpace admin, on a server installation with an unrestricted access  space. This is a mutating and slow operation rather than a destructive one: documents are copied back rather  than deleted, but the credentials of the previous storage are gone from the settings and have to be sent again  with `PUT api/2.0/settings/storage` to switch back. Repeating the call while a migration is running starts  another one, so poll instead. Resetting the storage is also the step that makes  `POST api/2.0/settings/encryption/start` possible, since encryption only covers the local storage.
