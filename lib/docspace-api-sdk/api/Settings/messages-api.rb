The caller needs the portal-settings right of a  DocSpace administrator - the portal owner and a DocSpace administrator qualify, any other member is refused.  Send the new state as `turnOn`: `true` publishes the form, `false` hides it. The change covers the whole  portal, applies to the next sign-in page without a restart, is recorded in the audit trail, and repeating the  call with the same value leaves the portal as it is. What comes back is a localized confirmation message  rather than the stored flag - read the flag as `enableAdmMess` from `GET api/2.0/settings`, which needs no  token. That flag is also forced on while the portal's payment has lapsed, so it can report `true` on a portal  where the form was switched off here. The form itself posts to `POST api/2.0/settings/sendadmmail` and this  setting gates nothing else: the notifications administrators receive as portal members are subscribed  separately with `POST api/2.0/settings/notification`.

When the caller is not signed  in and this installation has a CAPTCHA configured, `recaptchaResponse` has to carry a solved challenge of the  `recaptchaType` that `GET api/2.0/settings` publishes together with the site key, and a missing or stale  answer refuses the call. `culture` picks the language of the letter. Delivery is queued and reaches the  administrators subscribed to administrator notifications, so a confirmed call means accepted rather than read,  and the answer is a localized confirmation. Attempts are rate limited per address and per operation, and  further ones are refused with 429.

The invitation is  not an account: the invitee becomes a member only after following the link, and the role it grants, user or  room administrator, follows the trusted-domain settings and drops to user once the portal's paid places are  taken. Where the installation caps invitations, an accepted call spends one of those counted by  `invitationLimit`, and only about a dozen calls from one address in two minutes are accepted.
