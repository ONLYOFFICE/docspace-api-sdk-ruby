Nothing has to be called first and a DocSpace administrator is required; the  request is only queued, so the parse ends shortly after the call returns and  `GET api/2.0/migration/status` stops reporting it. The call is destructive for the uploaded data: the whole  upload folder is removed and the backup has to be sent to `migrationFileUpload.ashx` again before a new parse.  It is idempotent - cancelling when nothing is running still answers 200 - and it undoes nothing that was  already written to the portal. Only the parse stage is stopped, the job whose `parseResult.operation` is  `parse`: an import started by `POST api/2.0/migration/migrate` keeps running, and a finished import is  discarded with `POST api/2.0/migration/clear` instead.

A DocSpace administrator is required, and importing a user as `DocSpaceAdmin` additionally  requires the caller to be the portal owner unless a user with that email is an administrator of this portal  already, otherwise the whole call is rejected with 403 before anything is imported. The job is queued and the  call answers with an empty body at once: watch `progress`, `successedUsers`, `failedUsers` and `error` in  `GET api/2.0/migration/status` and read what each step did from `GET api/2.0/migration/logs`. The import  writes to the portal and cannot be undone, and a repeat is no help: a call made while the job runs is ignored,  and once the job has ended the uploaded backup is deleted, so a new call has nothing to read until the archive  is uploaded and parsed again. When the import is done, close it with `POST api/2.0/migration/finish`, which can  also mail the imported users their activation link.
